       [Audio]A father with three children has been diagnosed with colon cancer. The man’s mother and grandfather had colon cancer, too. The man wonders if the cancers in his family have a genetic cause. He decides to have his genome analyzed to search for cancer-causing variants. If the analysis identifies one, the family wants to screen the children for the variant, too. They know that frequent screenings for people at high risk of developing colon cancer is a very effective prevention strategy. Use gene.iobio to conduct the analysis and advise the family. (Possible animation: We see people icons of a family with three children. The father is a different color than the other, let’s say he’s blue. Then a family tree appears and we see the man’s mom and grandpa are blue, too. A double helix spirals across the screen. One rung in the DNA changes color. Question marks appear on kids)

To reduce their chances of suffering a severe stroke, she is going to prescribe an anti-blood-clotting drug called Warfarin for them all. Each patient’s genes influence how their liver will process the drug. Giving a patient with a genetic sensitivity to Warfarin too high a dose could cause abnormal bleeding.

At one position in the gene, you can have either an ‘A’ or a ‘G.’ So there are three possible variants at this position: ‘AA’, ‘AG’, or ‘GG’. You can see exactly what combination a patient has in gene.iobio by hovering over the variant.
     People with the GG variant can take a normal dose of Warfarin. People with the AG variant have some sensitivity and need a lower dose. People with the AA variant are very sensitive to Warfarin and need the lowest dose.
