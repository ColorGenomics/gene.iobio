- Big genes kill browser session

- Zoom after call freebayes broken. (vcfData has to incorporate new unique variants. rather than creating
clone - combinedData - need to remove unique2 from set before calling fb)

- When clicking on an impact, the filter panel rects are also set to opacity .1

- When multiple annotations, force highest impact one to show first (for coloring)

- position is off on bam chart, need to keep non-summarized data to display actual coverage

- inject bam and vcf into url




- How to tell which snpEff annotation belongs to which alt

- Can Yi change vcfstatsalive to show stats by alt, not variant counts?

- Use annotatation END= instead of calculated len?  are long variants rendering correctly?

- How to send bam header along with data to freebayes?

- Do I need to call bammerger before calling variants?

- Use she-bang on iobio snpEffServer.js

- Investigate memory usage java snpEffServer
