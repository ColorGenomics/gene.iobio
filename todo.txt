- Zoom after call freebayes broken. (vcfData has to incorporate new unique variants. rather than creating
clone - combinedData - need to remove unique2 from set before calling fb)

- Circle transcript area when mouseover variant

- When clicking on an impact, the filter panel rects are also set to opacity .1
- When multiple annotations, force highest impact one to show first (for coloring)

- How to tell which snpEff annotation belongs to which alt

- Can Yi change vcfstatsalive to show stats by alt, not variant counts?

- Use annotatation END= instead of calculated len?  are long variants rendering correctly?

- How to send bam header along with data to freebayes?

- Do I need to call bammerger before calling variants?

- Use she-bang on iobio snpEffServer.js

- Investigate memory usage java snpEffServer 

- position is off on bam chart

- duplicate snps showing up on vcf track after compare?

- select transcript on hover over text or svg

- show selected file names in tracks ( or in info tooltip in top section)

- x-axis slightly off for bam chart due to y-axis

- inject bam and vcf into url

- variants at very beginning and end of chart are truncated
