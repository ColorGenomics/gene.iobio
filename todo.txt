Quick must have fixes
-----------------------------------
- Clinvar first row in matrix (sort so that only pathogenic, likely pathogenic are considered?)
- Transcript dropdown gets munged.

Blockers
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Sam pileup stream gets truncated when concurrent streams.

 - VCF coverage (in genotype field) isn't matching circled bam depth on
   platinum data sets

- Big genes kill browser session (robo1)

- Some genes (with weird transcripts?) do nothing

- clinvar not working on large genes (ttn, dmd)

- take out extra x-axis when both bam and vcf are shown in variant card

- Inject #contig in header for afserver (for remote files)


important
-------------------------------------------
- How to deal with comparisons on multi-allelic genotypes

- Mode of inheritance - dominant (present in affected, cannot be present in unaffected)

- Affected/Unaffected status on datasources dialog

- Add Variant Prioritization (VVP)

- Sift and PolyPhen

- Switching to diff color scheme doesn't refresh fb variants.  
  FB variants not in feature matrix. (this should also result in inheritance and af data being updated on fb variants)

- Additional rows in matrix for 
	1. 'Proband only polymorphism'. This would be any variant that is present in the proband as either a heterozygous or homozygous alternate, but is homozygous reference in all other samples - just the parents in this case.

	2. 'Proband only homozygous' would be a homozygous alternate site in the proband, where all other samples show homozygous reference or are heterozygous.

- When url entered doesn't load bam/vcf, need to send error message insteading of staying 'in progress' with loading message



critical
----------
- When multiple annotations, force highest impact one to show first (for coloring)

- Genome build selection in data sources, different dbs for snpEff server

- responsive layout for mobile



less critical
-------------

- remove af histogram and server call, replace with calculated frequencies from af data (after injected from 1000g, ExAC data) 




can wait
-----------
- Use annotatation END= instead of calculated len?  are long variants rendering correctly?

- Use she-bang on iobio snpEffServer.js

- Investigate memory usage java snpEffServer 

- When zooming into region, transcript chart in variant card still hanging onto features (cds, utr) outside of region.
