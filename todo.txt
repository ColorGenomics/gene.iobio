Quick must have fixes
-----------------------------------
- FB variant filtered out MYLK2 CH20 30409363 a->g (qualit score 8)
- Bam area chart - wrong y scale (see AIRE low coverage)

- Clin var filters: split out likely pathogenic, likely benign
- Hover over variant should circle coverage in mom and dad
- Use X instead of arrow for missing variant
- OK button on data card minimizes card
- Clinvar first row in matrix (sort so that only pathogenic, likely pathogenic are considered?)
- Transcript dropdown gets munged.
- Show fb count separately 

Blockers
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Make sure clinvar updates FB variants and that FB variants are in feature matrix

- Inject #contig in header for afserver (for remote files)

- Big genes kill browser session (robo1)

- Some genes (with weird transcripts?) do nothing

- clinvar not working on large genes (ttn, dmd)

- take out extra x-axis when both bam and vcf are shown in variant card

- datasources dialog bugs - 
   - Safari only: relationship dropdown is open and won't close


important
-------------------------------------------
- Bam chart doesn't scale on x the same as transcript chart and variant chart

- Display applied filters in variant card (by badge)

- Display missing variants count in separate badge

- How to deal with comparisons on multi-allelic genotypes

- Mode of inheritance - dominant (present in affected, cannot be present in unaffected)

- Affected/Unaffected status on datasources dialog


- Add Variant Prioritization (VVP)

- Sift and PolyPhen

- Switching to diff color scheme doesn't refresh fb variants.  
  FB variants not in feature matrix. (this should also result in inheritance and af data being updated on fb variants)

- Additional rows in matrix for 
	1. 'Proband only polymorphism'. This would be any variant that is present in the proband as either a heterozygous or homozygous alternate, but is homozygous reference in all other samples - just the parents in this case.

	2. 'Proband only homozygous' would be a homozygous alternate site in the proband, where all other samples show homozygous reference or are heterozygous.

- When url entered doesn't load bam/vcf, need to send error message insteading of staying 'in progress' with loading message



critical
----------
- When multiple annotations, force highest impact one to show first (for coloring)

- Genome build selection in data sources, different dbs for snpEff server

- responsive layout for mobile



less critical
-------------

- remove af histogram and server call, replace with calculated frequencies from af data (after injected from 1000g, ExAC data) 




can wait
-----------
- Use annotatation END= instead of calculated len?  are long variants rendering correctly?

- Use she-bang on iobio snpEffServer.js

- Investigate memory usage java snpEffServer 

- When zooming into region, transcript chart in variant card still hanging onto features (cds, utr) outside of region.
