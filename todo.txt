blockers
-----------
- datasources dialog bug - names not showing up on variant cards, mixup with names when multiple samples added.

- Big genes kill browser session (robo1)

- <symbol> doesn't work on Safari (improper size).  Switch to using <defs>.  (Handlebar templates
  don't seem to work on Safari either. geez. )  Another browser polyfill would be to just
  inject paths directly into svg in symbolFunction.

- ClinVar matrix

- Additional rows in matrix for 
	1. 'Proband only polymorphism'. This would be any variant that is present in the proband as either a heterozygous or homozygous alternate, but is homozygous reference in all other samples - just the parents in this case.

	2. 'Proband only homozygous' would be a homozygous alternate site in the proband, where all other samples show homozygous reference or are heterozygous.


critical
----------
- When multiple annotations, force highest impact one to show first (for coloring)

- Switching to diff color scheme doesn't refresh fb variants.  
  FB variants not in feature matrix. (this should also result in inheritance and af data being updated on fb variants)

- Genome build selection in data sources, different dbs for snpEff server

- responsive layout for mobile



less critical
-------------
- When clicking on an impact, the filter panel rects are also set to opacity .1

- position is off on bam chart, need to keep non-summarized data to display actual coverage

- remove af histogram and server call, replace with calculated frequencies from af data (after injected from 1000g, ExAC data) 

- Need to set width of feature-matrix so that it doesn't take entire screen  (right now it is hardcoded to 740px)



can wait
-----------
- Use annotatation END= instead of calculated len?  are long variants rendering correctly?

- How to send bam header along with data to freebayes?

- Do I need to call bammerger before calling variants?

- Use she-bang on iobio snpEffServer.js

- Investigate memory usage java snpEffServer
