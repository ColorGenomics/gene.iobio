From Tuesday March 24th Meeting
-------------------------------------------
- Filtering by decimal points in af doesn't work.

- After zooming in, "cliff" created in coverate chart (due to averaing?)

Filters:
 - AF text input range should support 4 decimal precision
 - Use a different AF glyph, use stroke, no fill when AF not present
 - Coverage should filter on GT coverage; if not present, filter on BAM coverage
 - Display applied filters in variant card (by badge pf cpimt_d )

- Mode of inheritance - dominant (present in affected, cannot be present in unaffected)

- Affected/Unaffected status on datasources dialog

- When variant selected in Feature matrix, need to highlight area or variant for non-proband variant cards

- Show transcript (exons) in variant card by default (before zoom); show in the middle of coverage area chart with transparency

- When zoomed into a small region, there is a cliff on the borders of the zoomed region for the coverage chart
  (most likely caused by code that is summarizing data points)

- Add Variant Prioritization (VVP)

- Sift and PolyPhen



blockers
-----------

- datasources dialog bugs - 
   - names not showing up on variant cards
   - mixup with names after re-opening datasources dialog after all variant cards (for proband, mother, father)
     have been entered.
   - Safari only: relationship dropdown is open and won't close

- Big genes kill browser session (robo1)


- Switching to diff color scheme doesn't refresh fb variants.  
  FB variants not in feature matrix. (this should also result in inheritance and af data being updated on fb variants)


- ClinVar service

- Additional rows in matrix for 
	1. 'Proband only polymorphism'. This would be any variant that is present in the proband as either a heterozygous or homozygous alternate, but is homozygous reference in all other samples - just the parents in this case.

	2. 'Proband only homozygous' would be a homozygous alternate site in the proband, where all other samples show homozygous reference or are heterozygous.

- When url entered doesn't load bam/vcf, need to send error message insteading of staying 'in progress' with loading message


critical
----------
- When multiple annotations, force highest impact one to show first (for coloring)

- Genome build selection in data sources, different dbs for snpEff server

- responsive layout for mobile



less critical
-------------
- When clicking on an impact, the filter panel rects are also set to opacity .1

- position is off on bam chart, need to keep non-summarized data to display actual coverage

- remove af histogram and server call, replace with calculated frequencies from af data (after injected from 1000g, ExAC data) 




can wait
-----------
- Use annotatation END= instead of calculated len?  are long variants rendering correctly?

- How to send bam header along with data to freebayes?

- Use she-bang on iobio snpEffServer.js

- Investigate memory usage java snpEffServer
