- Make sure clinvar updates FB variants and that FB variants are in feature matrix

- How to deal with comparisons on multi-allelic genotypes

- Inject #contig in header for afserver (for remote files)


From Tuesday March 24th Meeting
-------------------------------------------

- After zooming in, "cliff" created in coverate chart (due to averaing?)

Filters:
 - Use a different AF glyph, use stroke, no fill when AF not present
 - Coverage should filter on GT coverage; if not present, filter on BAM coverage
 - Display applied filters in variant card (by badge pf cpimt_d )

- Mode of inheritance - dominant (present in affected, cannot be present in unaffected)

- Affected/Unaffected status on datasources dialog

- When zoomed into a small region, there is a cliff on the borders of the zoomed region for the coverage chart
  (most likely caused by code that is summarizing data points)

- Add Variant Prioritization (VVP)

- Sift and PolyPhen



blockers
-----------

- datasources dialog bugs - 
   - Safari only: relationship dropdown is open and won't close

- Big genes kill browser session (robo1)

- Switching to diff color scheme doesn't refresh fb variants.  
  FB variants not in feature matrix. (this should also result in inheritance and af data being updated on fb variants)

- Additional rows in matrix for 
	1. 'Proband only polymorphism'. This would be any variant that is present in the proband as either a heterozygous or homozygous alternate, but is homozygous reference in all other samples - just the parents in this case.

	2. 'Proband only homozygous' would be a homozygous alternate site in the proband, where all other samples show homozygous reference or are heterozygous.

- When url entered doesn't load bam/vcf, need to send error message insteading of staying 'in progress' with loading message


critical
----------
- When multiple annotations, force highest impact one to show first (for coloring)

- Genome build selection in data sources, different dbs for snpEff server

- responsive layout for mobile



less critical
-------------

- remove af histogram and server call, replace with calculated frequencies from af data (after injected from 1000g, ExAC data) 




can wait
-----------
- Use annotatation END= instead of calculated len?  are long variants rendering correctly?

- Use she-bang on iobio snpEffServer.js

- Investigate memory usage java snpEffServer
